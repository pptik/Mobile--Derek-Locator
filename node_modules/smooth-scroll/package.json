  "readme": "# Smooth Scroll [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll)\nA lightweight script to animate scrolling to anchor links. Smooth Scroll works great with [Gumshoe](https://github.com/cferdinandi/gumshoe).\n\n[Download Smooth Scroll](https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll/archive/master.zip) / [View the demo](http://cferdinandi.github.io/smooth-scroll/)\n\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nCompiled and production-ready code can be found in the `dist` directory. The `src` directory contains development code.\n\n### 1. Include Smooth Scroll on your site.\n\n```html\n<script src=\"dist/js/smooth-scroll.js\"></script>\n```\n\n### 2. Add the markup to your HTML.\n\nTurn anchor links into Smooth Scroll links by adding the `[data-scroll]` data attribute. Give the anchor location an ID just like you normally would.\n\n```html\n<a data-scroll href=\"#bazinga\">Anchor Link</a>\n...\n<span id=\"bazinga\">Bazinga!</span>\n```\n\n### 3. Initialize Smooth Scroll.\n\nIn the footer of your page, after the content, initialize Smooth Scroll. And that's it, you're done. Nice work!\n\n```html\n<script>\n\tsmoothScroll.init();\n</script>\n```\n\n\n\n## Installing with Package Managers\n\nYou can install Smooth Scroll with your favorite package manager.\n\n* **[NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/):** `npm install cferdinandi/smooth-scroll`\n* **[Bower](http://bower.io/):** `bower install https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll.git`\n* **[Component](http://component.io/):** `component install cferdinandi/smooth-scroll`\n\n\n\n## Working with the Source Files\n\nIf you would prefer, you can work with the development code in the `src` directory using the included [Gulp build system](http://gulpjs.com/). This compiles, lints, and minifies code.\n\n### Dependencies\nMake sure these are installed first.\n\n* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)\n* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) `sudo npm install -g gulp`\n\n### Quick Start\n\n1. In bash/terminal/command line, `cd` into your project directory.\n2. Run `npm install` to install required files.\n3. When it's done installing, run one of the task runners to get going:\n\t* `gulp` manually compiles files.\n\t* `gulp watch` automatically compiles files when changes are made and applies changes using [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/).\n\n\n\n## Options and Settings\n\nSmooth Scroll includes smart defaults and works right out of the box. But if you want to customize things, it also has a robust API that provides multiple ways for you to adjust the default options and settings.\n\n### Global Settings\n\nYou can pass options and callbacks into Smooth Scroll through the `init()` function:\n\n```javascript\nsmoothScroll.init({\n\tselector: '[data-scroll]', // Selector for links (must be a class, ID, data attribute, or element tag)\n\tselectorHeader: null, // Selector for fixed headers (must be a valid CSS selector) [optional]\n\tspeed: 500, // Integer. How fast to complete the scroll in milliseconds\n\teasing: 'easeInOutCubic', // Easing pattern to use\n\toffset: 0, // Integer. How far to offset the scrolling anchor location in pixels\n\tcallback: function ( anchor, toggle ) {} // Function to run after scrolling\n});\n```\n\n***Note:*** *To programatically add Smooth Scroll to all anchor links on a page, pass `selector: 'a'` into `init`. The script checks that the link points to the current page before running.*\n\n#### Easing Options\n\n**Linear**\n*Moves at the same speed from start to finish.*\n\n* `Linear`\n\n\n**Ease-In**\n*Gradually increases in speed.*\n\n* `easeInQuad`\n* `easeInCubic`\n* `easeInQuart`\n* `easeInQuint`\n\n\n**Ease-In-Out**\n*Gradually increases in speed, peaks, and then gradually slows down.*\n\n* `easeInOutQuad`\n* `easeInOutCubic`\n* `easeInOutQuart`\n* `easeInOutQuint`\n\n\n**Ease-Out**\n*Gradually decreases in speed.*\n\n* `easeOutQuad`\n* `easeOutCubic`\n* `easeOutQuart`\n* `easeOutQuint`\n\n\nLearn more about the different easing patterns and what they do at [easings.net](http://easings.net/).\n\n### Override settings with data attributes\n\nSmooth Scroll also lets you override global settings on a link-by-link basis using the `[data-options]` data attribute.\n\n```html\n<a data-scroll\n   data-options='{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"speed\": 500,\n\t\t\t\t\t\"easing\": \"easeInOutCubic\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"offset\": 0\n\t\t\t\t}'\n>\n\tAnchor Link\n</a>\n```\n\n***Note:*** *You must use [valid JSON](http://jsonlint.com/) in order for the `data-options` feature to work. Does not support the `callback` method.*\n\n### Use Smooth Scroll events in your own scripts\n\nYou can also call Smooth Scroll's scroll animation events in your own scripts.\n\n#### animateScroll()\nAnimate scrolling to an anchor.\n\n```javascript\nsmoothScroll.animateScroll(\n\tanchor, // Node to scroll to. ex. document.querySelector( '#bazinga' )\n\ttoggle, // Node that toggles the animation, OR an integer. ex. document.querySelector( '#toggle' )\n\toptions // Classes and callbacks. Same options as those passed into the init() function.\n);\n```\n\n**Example 1**\n\n```javascript\nvar anchor = document.querySelector( '#bazinga' );\nsmoothScroll.animateScroll( anchor );\n```\n\n**Example 2**\n\n```javascript\nvar anchor = document.querySelector( '#bazinga' );\nvar toggle = document.querySelector('#toggle');\nvar options = { speed: 1000, easing: 'easeOutCubic' };\nsmoothScroll.animateScroll( anchor, toggle, options );\n```\n\n**Example 3**\n\n```javascript\n// You can optionally pass in a y-position to scroll to as an integer\nsmoothScroll.animateScroll( 750 );\n```\n\n#### destroy()\nDestroy the current `smoothScroll.init()`. This is called automatically during the `init` function to remove any existing initializations.\n\n```javascript\nsmoothScroll.destroy();\n```\n\n\n### Fixed Headers\n\nIf you're using a fixed header, Smooth Scroll will automatically offset scroll distances by the header height. Pass in a valid CSS selector for your fixed header as an option to the `init`.\n\nIf you have multiple fixed headers, pass in the last one in the markup.\n\n```html\n<nav data-scroll-header>\n\t...\n</nav>\n...\n<script>\n\tsmoothScroll.init({\n\t\tselectorHeader: '[data-scroll-header]'\n\t});\n</script>\n```\n\n### Animating links to other pages\n\nThis is an often requested feature, but Smooth Scroll does not include an option to animate scrolling to links on other pages.\n\nYou can attempt to implement it using the API, but it's very difficult to prevent the automatic browser jump when the page loads, and anything I've done to work around it results in weird, janky issues, so I've decided to leave this out of the core. Here's a potential workaround...\n\n1. Do *not* add the `data-scroll` attribute to links to other pages. Treat them like normal links, and include your anchor link hash as normal.\n\n    ```html\n    <a href=\"some-page.html#example\">\n    ```\n2. Add the following script to the footer of your page, after the `smoothScroll.init()` function.\n\n    ```html\n    <script>\n        if ( window.location.hash ) {\n        \tvar anchor = document.querySelector( window.location.hash ); // Get the anchor\n        \tvar toggle = document.querySelector( 'a[href*=\"' + window.location.hash + '\"]' ); // Get the toggle (if one exists)\n            var options = {}; // Any custom options you want to use would go here\n            smoothScroll.animateScroll( anchor, toggle, options );\n        }\n    </script>\n    ```\n\n\n## Browser Compatibility\n\nSmooth Scroll works in all modern browsers, and IE 9 and above.\n\nSmooth Scroll is built with modern JavaScript APIs, and uses progressive enhancement. If the JavaScript file fails to load, or if your site is viewed on older and less capable browsers, anchor links will jump the way they normally would.\n\n\n## Known Issues\n\n### `<body>` styling\n\nIf the `<body>` element has been assigned a height of `100%` or `overflow: hidden`, Smooth Scroll is unable to properly calculate page distances and will not scroll to the right location. The `<body>` element can have a fixed, non-percentage based height (ex. `500px`), or a height of `auto`, and an `overflow` of `visible`.\n\n### Animating from the bottom\n\nAnimated scrolling links at the very bottom of the page (example: a \"scroll to top\" link) will stop animated almost immediately after they start when using certain easing patterns. This is an issue that's been around for a while and I've yet to find a good fix for it. I've found that `easeOut*` easing patterns work as expected, but other patterns can cause issues.
